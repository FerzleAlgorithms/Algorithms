<p>A list of AI-related links of interest that I have come across or have been 
  recommended to me. Not strictly related to the algorithms content here, 
  but close enough and this seemed like a good place to put it.</p>

<h3>Articles/Books</h3>
<ul class="resource-list">
    <li><a href="https://www.aisafetybook.com/" 
      target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI Safetey, Ethics, & Society Textbook</a>
        The site hosts Introduction to AI Safety, Ethics, and Society, a textbook and free online course by 
        Dan Hendrycks (of the Center for AI Safety). 
        It explores how AI's rapid advancement poses societal risks and insists that safety isn't just a tech problem—it 
        demands insights from engineering, economics, and more, covering topics like catastrophic risks, safe design, ethics, 
        governance, and collective action.

    target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Better Way to Think about AI (The Atlantic)</a>
    This Atlantic piece argues that instead of chasing after full automation—like catapulting AI across a canyon—we 
    should build bridges of collaboration, using AI to enhance work with doctors, teachers, lawyers, and more rather 
    than automate them out of existence.</li>

      target="_blank" rel="noopener">What is ChatGPT Doing and Why Does it Work? (Stepehn Wolfram)</a>
      Wolfram explains that ChatGPT doesn't "understand" in any mystical sense; it simply predicts the next token in a sequence 
      based on patterns across billions of words, constructing responses word by word according to what's statistically plausible.
      He also points out that adding a dash of randomness—tweaked via the "temperature" parameter—lets the model avoid bland 
      repetition and produce outputs that feel more creative, even though the underlying process remains entirely probabilistic.

<h3>Videos</h3>
<ul class="resource-list">
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xTGNNLPyMI" 
    target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deep Dive into LLMs like ChatGPT (YouTube)</a>
    Very good 3.5 hour introduction video intro to Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT.
    Only slightly out of date on a few details (video from February 2025?). 
    According to the creator, Andrej Karpathy: This is a general audience deep dive into the Large Language 
    Model (LLM) AI technology that powers ChatGPT and related products. 
    It is covers the full training stack of how the models are developed, 
    along with mental models of how to think about their "psychology", 
    and how to get the best use them in practical applications.

      and 
      <a href="https://www.3blue1brown.com/?v=neural-networks">Neural Networks (3Blue1Brown)</a>
      According to the YoutTube course page: "Learn the basics of neural networks and backpropagation, 
      one of the most important algorithms for the modern world." 
      A good set of videos that gets a little technical. Begins with older videos about neural networks in general, 
      then moves on to more recent videos about recent advances in LLMs. (Latest videos are from 2024 and early 2025.)

      A decent and goofy introduction to ChatGPT by Kyle Hill. Ads and commercials, but not bad otherwise. (June 2023.)
