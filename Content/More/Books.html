<h2>Other Books</h2>

<p>Here are some of my more traditional open-access textbooks.
Unlike this website, these books were written with very little assistance from AI.
They were written the old fashioned way&mdash;with blood, sweat, and tears.
If for some reason you want access to older versions of these, let me know.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/Algorithms/PDFS/AIDM_4_0.pdf">An Active Introduction to Discrete Mathematics</a>,
     Version 4.0, Charles Cusack, 2025.<br>
     An updated version of my previous book written for a more general audience with no
     prerequisites assumed. This version has very little algorithm-related content 
     (which explains the title change). It is suitable for computer science students,
     secondary mathematics education students (particularly in Michigan), and general
     education students.

  <li><a href="/Algorithms/PDFS/AIDMA_3_5.pdf">An Active Introduction to Discrete Mathematics 
    and Algorithms</a>,
     Version 3.5, Charles Cusack, 2024.<br>
     The latest version of my discrete mathematics textbook intended specifically
     for computer science students. This book works best with students who have had
     programming and data structures courses.

  <li><a href="/Algorithms/PDFS/AIDMA_3_0.pdf">An Active Introduction to Discrete Mathematics 
    and Algorithms</a>,
     Version 3.0, Charles Cusack, 2023.<br>
     A previous version of my discrete mathematics textbook intended specifically
     for computer science students. This book works best with students who have had
     programming and data structures courses. I do not think there is any advantage to this
     over Version 3.5, but here it is just in case.
