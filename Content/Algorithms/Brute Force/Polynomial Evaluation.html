      Here we will describe the brute force algorithm that solves the
      <a class="problem" href="?path=Problems%2FFoundational%2FPolynomial%20Evaluation">Polynomial Evaluation</a>
      problem.

    <h2>Design and Strategy</h2>
    <p>
      To evaluate a polynomial of the form
      \( P(x) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + \dots + a_nx^n \),
      a straightforward method is to compute each term \( a_i x^i \) separately and sum the results.
    </p>
    <p>
      For each term, we compute \( x^i \) by multiplying \( x \) by itself \( i \) times. This means that evaluating the full polynomial requires nested loops: one to sum each term and one to compute each power.
    </p>
    <p>
      This brute-force approach is easy to understand, but it is inefficient. For a polynomial of degree \( n \), it requires roughly \( O(n^2) \) operations.
    </p>

<ol class="spaced">
  <li>Let \( \text{result} = 0 \).</li>
  <li>For \( i \) from 0 to \( n \):
    <ol>
      <li>Set \( \text{power} = 1 \).</li>
      <li>Repeat \( i \) times: \( \text{power} = \text{power} \times x \).</li>
      <li>Add \( a[i] \times \text{power} \) to \( \text{result} \).</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Return \( \text{result} \).</li>
</ol>

    <p>This simple strategy uses no clever optimizations, so it exemplifies a <strong>brute-force</strong> approach: just rely on the definition of the problem and do exactly what it suggests.
    </p>

  <section id="demo" section-title="Interactive Demo">
  <p>This demo should give you a really good idea of how the algorithm works. 
  It shows each step of the computation and counts the number of additions and multiplications
  so you can see exactly how long it takes. And later you can compare it with better algorithms.</p>

  <section id="analysis" section-title="Time/Space Analysis">
    <h2>Time/Space Analysis</h2>
    <p><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> The outer loop runs \( n + 1 \) times, and each iteration has an inner loop of up to \( i \) multiplications. The total number of operations is \( 1 + 2 + \dots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \), which is \( O(n^2) \).</p>
    <p><strong>Space Complexity:</strong> The algorithm uses only a small number of variables for the result and intermediate power computations, so the space complexity is \( O(1) \).</p>
  </section>

  <section id="variations" section-title="Variations/Improvements">
  <h2>Variations/Improvements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>By avoiding redundant multiplications when computing \( x^i \), we can reduce the total time to linear \( O(n) \). For example, by reusing \( x^{i-1} \) to compute \( x^i \), we only need one multiplication per term.</li>
    <li>Horner's Rule (or Horner's Method) is a more efficient algorithm that rewrites the polynomial as nested multiplications:
      \[ P(x) = (...((a_n x + a_{n-1})x + a_{n-2})x + \dots + a_1)x + a_0 \]
      This avoids computing powers entirely and the total number of operations is also \( O(n) \),
      but with slightly smaller constants.

    <h2>In-Class Activities</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Manual Evaluation:</strong> Have students evaluate \( P(x) = 3 + 2x + 5x^2 - 7 x^3 + 9 x^4 \) for \( x = 5 \) using the brute-force method by hand.</li>
      <li><strong>Code Comparison:</strong> Walk through the provided brute-force implementation line by line with a sample array of coefficients.</li>
      <li><strong>Exact Analysis:</strong> Use the interactive demo to derive formulas for the exact 
      number of multiplications and additions needed for a polynomial of degree \(n\).</li>
      <li><strong>Cost Estimation:</strong> Ask students to estimate the total number of operations for a degree-10 polynomial.</li>
      <li><strong>Slight Improvement:</strong> The algorithm can be very slightly improved by reducing the
	  number of total multiplications by about \(n\). Modify the algorithm to do this. 
	  (But see the next item for an even more drastic improvement).</li>
      <li><strong>Linear-Time Algorithm:</strong> Improve the algorithm to work in linear time.
      Begin by working in small groups talking it through. If you get stuck, work through a few examples
      with the <a class="problem" href="?path=Demos/Brute%20Force/Polynomial%20Evaluation%20(Linear)%20Demo">Polynomial Evaluation (Linear) Demo</a> and see if you can extract the idea from there.
      Give clear code/pseudocode of your algorithm!
      </li>
      <li><strong>Re-Inventing Horner's Rule:</strong> In small groups, work together to try to devise
      an algorithm based on Horner's Rule.
      If you get stuck, take a look at the 
      <a class="problem" href="?path=Demos/Transform-and-Conquer/Horners%20Rule%20Demo">Horner's Rule Demo</a> for inspiration. In particular, it can help you better understand how to factor a polynomial

      used by the brute force algorithm to evaluate a polynomial of degree \(n\) and verify that it
      is \(O(n^2)\).</li>
      <li><strong>Linear-Time Version:</strong> Modify the brute force algorithm so it operates
      in linear time. Explain what change(s) you had to make to the algorithm to reduce the time.
      Did it require more space?</li>
        <li><strong>Taylor Polynomial Evaluation:</strong> 
        The \(n\)-degree Taylor Polynomial for the exponential function is defined as 
        \( e^x \approx T_n(x) = 1 + \frac{x}{1!} + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \dots + \frac{x^n}{n!}.\) 
        It is an an approximation of the exact value of the function.

          <li><strong>Compute Derivative At a Point:</strong> Given a polynomial \( P(x) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + \dots + a_nx^n \), the derivative is \( P'(x) = a_1 + 2a_2x + 3a_3x^2 + \dots + na_nx^{n-1} \). Assume the coefficients are provided in an array \( [a_0, a_1, \dots, a_n] \), and you are given a value \( x \). Design an algorithm to evaluate \( P'(x) \) efficiently. Analyze the time and space complexity of your algorithm.</li>
          <li><strong>Compute Derivative:</strong> Given a polynomial \( P(x) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + \dots + a_nx^n \), the derivative is \( P'(x) = a_1 + 2a_2x + 3a_3x^2 + \dots + na_nx^{n-1} \). Assume the coefficients are provided in an array \( [a_0, a_1, \dots, a_n] \).
          Design an algorithm to return the derivative, \( P'(x) \), as a function, efficiently.
