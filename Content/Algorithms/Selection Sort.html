  <h1>Selection Sort </h1>

<h2>Problem Solved</h2>
	<p>Selection Sort solves the
	<a class="problem" href="?path=Problems%2F1_Foundational%2FSorting">Sorting</a>
	problem.
 </p>



  <h2>Design and Strategy</h2>
  <p>
    Selection sort is an iterative sorting algorithm that uses a <b>brute-force</b> approach to sort a list by repeatedly 
    selecting the <strong>maximum (or minimum)</strong> element from the unsorted portion of the array and placing 
    it in the correct position. The algorithm conceptually divides the array into two parts: a <strong>sorted subarray</strong> 
    that grows from the end, and an <strong>unsorted subarray</strong> that shrinks with each pass.
	Thus, Selection Sort can be viewed as a <strong>decrease-and-conquer</strong> algorithm because the 
	problem size decreases with every iteration.
  
  </p>
  <p>
    In each iteration, the algorithm scans the unsorted portion of the array to find the largest 
	unsorted element. 
    Once identified, this maximum value is swapped with the rightmost element in the unsorted subarray. 
    This operation effectively moves the largest unsorted value into its final position in the sorted subarray. 
    After the swap, the boundary between the sorted and unsorted portions shifts one position to the left, 
	expanding the sorted portion and reducing the unsorted one.
	This process continues until the unsorted portion is reduced to a single element,
     at which point the array is fully sorted.

  <p>
    The algorithm typically uses two pointers:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The <strong>i pointer</strong> marks the boundary between the unsorted and sorted portions, starting at the end of the array and moving leftward.</li>
    <li>During each iteration, the <strong>j pointer</strong> traverses from the beginning of the unsorted portion up to index i, scanning to find the maximum value.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    After each pass, the element at index i is guaranteed to be in the correct position. 
	The algorithm proceeds by decrementing i and repeating the process until the array is sorted.  </p>
  <p>
More formally, the algorithm works as follows:
  </p>
  
<ol>
    <li>Use pointer <strong>i</strong>, starting at the last index, moving leftward after each pass.</li>
    <li>In each iteration:
      <ul>
        <li>Find the maximum value in the unsorted portion using pointer <strong>j</strong> (from start up to <strong>i</strong>).</li>
        <li>Swap the maximum element found with the element at position <strong>i</strong>.</li>
        <li>Move pointer <strong>i</strong> one step left.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Repeat until the unsorted portion contains only one element.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Time/Space Analysis </h2>
  <p><b>Time Complexity:</b>
   To analyze the time complexity of Selection Sort, we consider the number of comparisons the algorithms does, since 
  it only swaps once the inner loop has terminated. Given the fixed nature of Selection Sort, it performs the 
   same number of comparisons regardless of the input. 
   This means its best-, average-, and worst-case time complexities are identical.
  </p>
<p>
  On each pass through the array, 
  Selection Sort scans the unsorted portion to find the maximum element and places it in its 
  correct position.
  In the first pass, it makes \( n - 1 \) comparisons. 
  In the second pass, it makes \( n - 2 \) comparisons, and so on, until just one element remains unsorted.
  Thus, the total number of comparisons is 
</p>
  <p>
    \[
    \sum_{i=1}^{n-1}i = \frac{(n-1)(n)}{2} = O(n^2).
    \]
  </p>

  <p>
  <b>Space Complexity:</b>
    The algorithm uses only a constant amount of auxiliary memory (a few index variables and a swap variable). 
	Therefore, the space complexity is \( O(1). \)
  </p>
  <p></p>


  <h2>Variations/Improvements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li> <strong>Left-to-Right Selection Sort (Minimum-Based)</strong>: A commonly used variant of Selection Sort 
      builds the sorted portion of the array from left to right by selecting the minimum value during each pass 
      and placing it at the beginning of the unsorted region. This approach contrasts with the max-to-end version, 
      where the largest value is placed at the end. </li>
    <li> <strong>Dual-Ended Optimization</strong>:
      A key optimization to standard Selection Sort involves simultaneously locating 
      both the minimum and maximum elements during each pass through the array. 
      This enhancement leverages the observation that, in each pass, one element can be placed at the beginning of 
      the unsorted region and another at the end, effectively sorting two elements per iteration instead of one.

  </ul>
