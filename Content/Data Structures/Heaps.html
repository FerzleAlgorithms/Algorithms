  <h1>Heaps</h1>
  
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    A <strong>heap</strong> is a tree-based abstract data type that maintains a partial order 
    between elements&mdash;in a <em>max-heap</em>, each node is at least as large as its children; 
    in a <em>min-heap</em>, each node is at most as large as its children.  We call this ordering
    criteria the <em>heap property</em>.
    From now on, will restrict
    our attention to max-heaps, leaving it to the reader to figure out what modifications are needed 
    in the case of a min-heap (It is easier to do this instead of referring to both min and max options
    throughout!).</p>
    <p>
    Heaps support efficient <code>insert</code>, <code>peek</code> (find min/max), 
    and <code>extractMax</code> operations, along with a few others that are needed to construct and
    maintain a heap. 
    They are used to implement priority queues, selection algorithms, and in-place sorting (Heapsort).
    Variations include <strong>binary heaps</strong>, <strong>binomial heaps</strong>, 
    and <strong>Fibonacci heaps</strong> (which offer different trade-offs for decrease-key and merge operations).
    We will focus on binary heaps for the remainder of this section. For more details about the other
    variations, see one of the following:
    <ul>

    </ul>
  </p>
  
  <h2>Basic Definition</h2>
  <p>
    A binary max-heap (hereafter simply referred to as heap) is a complete binary tree such that
    every node is at least as large as its children. The most common implementation uses an array. 
    Locating parents/children is very simple. For zero-based indexing, the relatives of the node
    with index \(i\) are:
        <ul>
      <li>left child (except for leaved) is at index \(2i + 1\)</li>
      <li>right child (except for leaves) is at index \(2i + 2\)</li>
      <li>parent (except for the root) is is at index \(\lfloor(i - 1)/2\rfloor\)</li>
    </ul>
  <p>
    Because a binary heap is always a <em>complete</em> binary tree&mdash;every level except possibly 
    the last is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible&mdash;you 
    can pack all elements into a single array without wasted spaces.  
    The parent/child relationships follow fixed index formulas, 
    so you avoid the memory overhead and pointer-chasing of node objects.  
    This contiguous layout improves cache locality and reduces per-node storage,
    making array-based heaps both simpler and faster than link-based implementations.
  </p>
    <p>
    In practice we often allocate an array larger than the current heap and keep a separate 
    <em>heapSize</em> variable to record how many entries are logically in the heap.  
    Whenever we compute a child index, we first check whether it is less 
    than <em>heapSize</em>; any index greater than or equal to <em>heapSize</em> is treated as non-existent, 
    even though it might remain within the array's physical bounds. If you are fortunate enough to 
    learn about Heapsort, you will see where this can come in handy!
  </p>
  <p>The demo below helps visualize both the parent/child relationships in the tree versus the array
  as well as the difference between the array size and heap size.

  <h3>Basic Operations</h3>
  The following are the operations that are necessary to maintain and use a heap.
  <ul> <li><code>heapify(A, i, heapSize)</code>: Given an array \(A\), an index \(i\) of
    a node whose children (if they exist) are heaps, but the node at index \(i\) might violate 
    the heap property, and current \(heapSize\), restore the heap property at index \(i\).</li>
    <li><code>buildMaxHeap(A)</code>: Rearrange the elements of an array \(A\) into a max-heap.</li>
    <li><code>insert(A, value, heapSize)</code>: Add \(value\) to the heap, increment \(heapSize\) by one,
     and ensure the array (up through heapSize) continues to be a valid heap.</li>
    <li><code>extractMax(A, heapSize)</code>: Remove the maximum value from the heap and make sure the
    heap property is maintained. Generally accomplished by swapping the root with the last element, 
    decrementing the heap size, then heapify at the root to fix the heap.</li>
    <li><code>peekMax(A)</code>: return \(A[0]\), the maximum value in the heap.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  We will discuss each of these operations in detail, give pseudocode and/or code, 
  give examples, and discuss the time and space complexity of each.
  Except for <code>peekMax(A)</code>, since it is just literally <code>return A[0]</code>,
  after checking that the heap is not empty. Clearly it has time and space complexity if \(O(1)\).
  </p>
  
  <h3 id="heapify">heapify(A, i, heapSize)</h3>
<p>
  Restores the max-heap property at index \(i\), assuming both its left and right subtrees 
  (within <code>heapSize</code>) are already valid heaps. It repeatedly swaps the value 
  at \(i\) with its larger child until the property holds. The code makes it look more 
  complicated than it really is. It first compares the node with its left child to see 
  which is larger, and then it compares the current largest with the right child.
  If the largest of these is not the current node, it swaps and calls heapify
  on the child it swapped with since the heap property might be violated in that node now.
  This demonstration shows heapify in action.

  </div>
</div>
<p>
  <strong>Time &amp; Space Analysis: </strong>
  Notice that each call to <code>heapify</code> does a constant (\(C\)) amount of work and then may make
  a recursive call on a node one level down the tree. 
  Since heaps are complete binary trees, they have a height of \(\lfloor \log n\rfloor\).
  Thus, the total amount of work done by heapfiy is at most \(C \lfloor \log n\rfloor = O(\log n)\).
  It uses only a fixed set of integer variables (for indices and swapping), 
  so the auxiliary space required is O(1).
</p>

<h3 id="build-max-heap">buildMaxHeap(A)</h3>
<p>
  Converts an arbitrary array into a valid max-heap by calling <code>heapify</code> on each non-leaf node. 
  Starting from the last internal node at index  \(\lfloor n/2 \rfloor - 1\) and moving backwards to 0 
  ensures that every subtree is fixed before moving up to its parent.

<p>
  <strong>Time &amp; Space Analysis:</strong>  
  <code>buildMaxHeap</code> makes about \(n/2\) calls to <code>heapify</code>, each of which 
  can take up to \(O(\log n)\) time, so it appears that it takes \(O(n\log n)\) time.
  However, most calls are on small subtrees near the bottom of the heap, and when added up,
  the total time turns out to be \(O(n)\). We leave it as an exercise to prove this.
  Only a constant number of index and temporary variables are used, so the auxiliary space is \(O(1)\).

<h3 id="insert">insert(A, value, heapSize)</h3>
<p>
  Appends <code>value</code> at index <code>heapSize</code>, increments <code>heapSize</code>, 
  and then "bubbles up" the new element: it repeatedly swaps the element with its parent while 
  it is larger than that parent, restoring the max-heap property.

<h4>Implementation in Java, C++, Python</h4>
We assume there are <code>swap</code> and <code>heapify</code> helpers available where needed.
Recall that a node at index \(i\) has parent at index \((i-1)/2\), where the floor is
not needed since integer division automatically truncates.

<h3 id="extract-max">extractMax(A, heapSize)</h3>

  Removes and returns the maximum element from the heap.  It swaps the root (<code>A[0]</code>) with the element at index <code>heapSize − 1</code>, decrements <code>heapSize</code>, and then calls <code>heapify(A, 0, heapSize)</code> to restore the max-heap property.

  <strong>Time &amp; Space Analysis:</strong>  
  Aside from the constant‐time swap and index arithmetic, we invoke <code>heapify</code> on the root,

   It uses only a handful of local variables, so its auxiliary space is \(O(1)\).
