  <!-- Motivation & Introduction -->
  <section id="introduction">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Exhaustive Search is a subtype of Brute Force in which we explicitly
      enumerate every possible candidate solution from a well-defined search 
      space, then test each candidate to see if it satisfies the problem's 
      constraints. Whereas Brute Force can also refer simply to "follow the 
      problem's definition verbatim" (e.g. Naive Fibonacci or Polynomial 
      Evaluation), Exhaustive Search emphasizes "generate & test all 
      candidates"&mdash;for example, every subset, every assignment, or every 
      placement&mdash;without pruning. Although it is simple and guarantees 
      correctness, the search space often grows exponentially (or worse), 
      making it feasible only for relatively small inputs or as a baseline 
      for comparison against more advanced techniques.

      <p>The 
    <a class="problem" href="?path=Problems/Other/Subset%20Sum">Subset-Sum</a> 
    problem asks: Given a set \(S = \{a_0, a_1, \dots, a_{n-1}\}\) of numbers (typically integers) 
    and a target \(T,\) is there a subset \(X \subseteq S\) whose elements sum to \(T?\)  
    The exhaustive search space consists of all \(2^n\) subsets of \(S.\)
     For each subset \(Xx\) the algorithms computes \(\displaystyle\sum_{x \in X} x\) 
     and compare it against \(T\).</p>

  <p>Here is over-simplified pseudocode for the exhaustive search Subset-Sum algorithm 
  that leaves out the important detail of how to generate each of the subsets of \(S\).
  See the

      <p>
      Assuming you have taken a discrete mathematics course, you know that there are \(2^n\)
      subsets of a set of size \(n,\) and since each subset has up to \(n\) elements, 
      computing the sum of the elements of a subset takes up to \(O(n)\) time.
      Thus, this algorithm has a computational complexity of \(O(n \cdot 2^n)\).
      Clearly that is not very fast, and this algorithm is only reasonable to use
      on reasonably small sets.
      </p>
      <p>
       For more details about this algorithm see the <a class="problem" 
    href="?path=Algorithms/Exhaustive Search/Subset%20Sum">Subset-Sum (Exhaustive Search)</a>
    page.

    <!-- Example 2: N-Queens -->
    <div class="example-box">
      <strong class="example-title">Example 2: N-Queens</strong>
      <p>
        The <a class="problem" href="?path=Problems/Other/N-Queens">N-Queens</a> 
        problem asks: Determine all legal ways of placing \(N\) queens on an \(N \times N\) chessboard,
        where by legal we mtan that none of the queens are attacking each other.
        If you are unfamilair with chess and/or what it means for queens to attack each other, read
        the N-Queens problem page before continuing.
        </p>
        <p>
        It is not hard to see that in a valid solution, exactly one queen must occupy each row.
        Given this, we represent a candidate placement by specifying which column the 
        queen occupies in each row. We can do this by storing an array \(Q\) of \(N\) numbers 
        ranging from 1 to \(N\), where \(Q[r]=c\) means that there is a queen at cell \([r,c]\)
        (That is, in row \(r\) and column \(c\)).
         A naive exhaustive search then considers all \(N^N\) possible arrays and rejects any 
         assignment in which two queens share a column or lie on the same diagonal.
         </p>
         
         <font style="color:red; font-size: 26px;">I am here!</font>

<p>Pseudocode (recursive, exhaustive over all \(N^N\) assignments):</p>
<pre><code>
function exhaustiveNQueens(N):
    // Q[r] will hold the column index of the queen in row r
    let Q be a new array of length N
    place(0, Q)

function place(r, Q):
    if r = N then
        // We have assigned a column to every row
        if noConflicts(Q) then
            output Q
        end if
        return
    end if

    // Try every possible column for row r
    for c from 0 to N - 1 do
        Q[r] = c
        place(r + 1, Q)
    end for
</code></pre>


      <p>Pseudocode (recursive, without pruning):</p>
      <pre><code style="width: 300px;">function placeQueens(r, Q):
    if r == N:
        if noConflict(Q):
            output Q
        return
    for c from 0 to N - 1:
        Q[r] = c
        placeQueens(r + 1, Q)

// Initial call:
placeQueens(0, new int[N])</code></pre>

      <p>
        Key points:
        <ul>
          <li>
            The outer recursion has \(N\) levels (one per row). At each row \(r\), 
            we try \(N\) columns. Total candidates = \(N^N\).
          </li>
          <li>
            At \(r = N\), we have a full assignment \(Q[0..N-1]\). Checking for 
            "no two queens attack each other" (columns+diagonals) takes \(O(N)\), 
            so overall \(O(N \times N^N)\).
          </li>
          <li>
            A more optimized brute force would enforce "one queen per row and column," 
            reducing the search space to \(N!\) permutations. But the truly "naive" 
            version visits all \(N^N\) assignments and filters out illegal ones.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Visualization:</em> Think of an \(N\)-ary tree of depth \(N\). At level \(r\), 
        you choose a column for row \(r\). Leaf nodes at depth \(N\) represent 
        complete candidate boards.

  <!-- Real-World Applications -->
  <section id="applications">
    <h2>Real-World Applications</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Password &amp; Key Cracking:</strong> For short keys, exhaustively generate 
        every possible key or password string until you find a match. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Small CSP Solvers:</strong> When only a few variables remain, enumerating 
        all assignments (e.g.\ 3-SAT or Sudoku on a few empty cells) can be done quickly.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Benchmarking &amp; Educational Demos:</strong> Use exhaustive search to 
        verify correctness of more advanced algorithms. It is often used as a teaching 
        tool to illustrate how pruning or dynamic programming provides speedups.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Exhaustive Hyperparameter Tuning:</strong> For a very small set of discrete 
        hyperparameter values (e.g.\ learning rate ? {0.01, 0.1}, depth ? {4,8}), generate 
        all combinations and test each configuration.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Small-Scale Puzzle Solvers:</strong> For puzzles like the 3×3 Magic Square or 
        4×4 sliding-tile, "generate all candidate boards" (or partial assignments) and test 
        validity.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Applicability -->
  <section id="applicability">
    <h2>When to Use</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Very Small Input Sizes:</strong> If \(n\) (or other parameters) is so small 
        that \(2^n\) or \(N^N\) is still feasible (e.g.\ \(n = 20\) for subsets, or \(N = 8\) 
        for 8-Queens).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Guaranteed Completeness:</strong> When you need to be certain you'll find 
        all solutions (e.g.\ list every valid N-Queen configuration or every subset that 
        sums to \(T\)).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Baseline Comparison:</strong> To compare against optimized or heuristic 
        methods (e.g.\ branch-and-bound, backtracking with pruning).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Educational / Illustrative:</strong> As a teaching tool, to show how naive 
        enumeration works and how quickly the search space explodes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Prototype or Fallback:</strong> If development time is extremely limited 
        and you can tolerate the performance cost for small instances.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Limitations -->
  <section id="limitations">
    <h2>Limitations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Exponential or Worse Growth:</strong> Typical search spaces are \(2^n\), 
        \(N^N\), or \(N!\), which rapidly become infeasible.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>No Pruning (Unless Added):</strong> Pure exhaustive search visits every 
        candidate, even if a partial assignment already violates constraints.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>High Constant Factors:</strong> Summing up or checking conflicts often costs 
        \(O(n)\) per candidate, compounding the exponential factor.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Deep Recursion Risks:</strong> Recursive subset generation or row assignments 
        can reach depth \(n\) or \(N\), potentially causing stack overflows.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Memory Overhead (for Storing Candidates):</strong> If you store all solutions 
        or keep large recursion stacks, you may exhaust memory before finishing.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Poor Insight into Problem Structure:</strong> Exhaustive methods do not leverage 
        problem-specific constraints to prune the search space early.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Not Suitable for Large Inputs:</strong> Even moderately sized \(n\) (e.g.\ 
        \(n = 30\)) can push \(2^n\) into the billions, which is entirely impractical.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Implementation Tips & Common Pitfalls -->
  <section id="tips">
    <h2>Implementation Tips &amp; Common Pitfalls</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Use a General Recursive or Iterative Pattern:</strong>  
        For "all subsets," write a single recursion with parameter \(i\) (include/exclude) 
        instead of hard-coding loops for each subset size. The same pattern applies to "all 
        assignments" (choose each variable's value).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Be Careful with Recursion Depth:</strong>  
        If \(n\) is large, recursion to depth \(n\) may cause stack overflow. Consider converting 
        to a bitmask loop (for subsets or assignments) or manage your own explicit stack.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Avoid Recomputing from Scratch:</strong>  
        In subset enumeration, maintain a running sum instead of summing the subset from 
        scratch at each leaf. In N-Queens, maintain auxiliary arrays (or bitmasks) for columns 
        and diagonals so conflict checks can be \(O(1)\) per placement.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Test on Small Inputs First:</strong>  
        Verify correctness by running on minimal cases (e.g.\ set of size 3 for subsets, 
        \(N=4\) for N-Queens) and print partial results to ensure you are visiting every 
        candidate.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Consider Early Termination if You Only Need One Solution:</strong>  
        If you only need to find "some valid solution," you can stop once you encounter it. 
        But if you need "all" solutions, do not terminate prematurely.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Mind Data Types &amp; Overflow:</strong>  
        Summing subset elements or indexing large arrays can overflow standard integers if 
        numbers get large. Use 64-bit types or big-integer libraries when needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Prepare for Large Memory Use:</strong>  
        If you store every valid subset or every queen placement in a list, memory can blow up 
        quickly. Consider streaming results or writing them to disk if necessary.
