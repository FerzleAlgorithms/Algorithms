  <h1>Brute Force</h1>
  
  <!-- Motivation & Introduction -->
<section id="introduction">
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Brute Force algorithms use the most straightforward approach—implementing a solution exactly as defined 
	in the problem without 
	worrying about efficiency. By following the problem’s specification verbatim (for example, 
	using the recursive formula for Fibonacci numbers or directly computing each term of a polynomial), 
	you guarantee correct results and gain insight into the problem’s structure. 
	Although this may involve redundant steps and doesn’t scale well for large inputs, 
	it offers a simple solution that’s quick to implement and, by closely mirroring the specification, 
	is less prone to errors than more complex techniques.

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    
    
     <div class="example-box">
    <strong class="example-title">Example 1: Naive Fibonacci</strong>
    <p>
    The most obvious way to computethe \(n\)th 
    <a class="problem" href="?path=Problems/Other/Fibonacci">Fibonacci number</a>,
     \(F(n)\),  is by  directly using the recursive definition:</p>
    <pre><code>function fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
      return n
    else:
      return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)</code></pre>
<p>If you are unfamilair with Fibonacci numbers, you should read the 
    <a class="problem" href="?path=Problems/Other/Fibonacci">Fibonacci number</a> page
    before continuing.</p>
    <p>Here is an example that shows the recursive calls made to 
    compute \(F(5)\) using the naive algorithm.</p>
    <div class="embeddedDemoContainer">
      <iframe
        class="embeddedDemo"
        src="/Algorithms/Content/Demos/Brute Force/Fibonacci 5 Naive Demo.html"
        allow="fullscreen"
        name="FibonacciRecursive-demo-5"
        style="height: 300px; min-height: 300px;"
      ></iframe>
    </div>
    <p>Because each call splits into two more calls (unless it hits a base case), the total number of calls grows exponentially—roughly \(O(2^n)\).
    But we can be more precise. 
    Since this algorithm computes \(F(n)\) by adding a bunch of 0s and 1s, 
    the time it takes is actually about
      \[
      O(F(n))=O\left(
           \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}
           \left( \left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^{n} 
	                \;-\; 
              \left(\frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^{n}
           \right)
            \right)
      = O\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^{n}\right).
  \]
    <p>
      Thus, this algorithm does not work well for values of \(n\) that are very large.
      For more details about this algorithm and a full analysis, see the 
      <a class="problem" href="?path=Algorithms/Brute%20Force/Fibonacci%20Naive">Fibonacci Naive</a>
      algorithm page.
    </p>
    <p>Hopefully it is pretty clear that this is <em>not</em> a good use of 
    the brute force technique! In fact, elsewhere we present several alternative algorithms
    for computing Fibonacci numbers that are much more efficient than this. </p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="example-box">
    <strong class="example-title">Example 2: Polynomial Evaluation</strong>
    <p>
      Suppose you have a degree-\(n\) polynomial with coefficients 
      \(a_{0},a_{1},\dots,a_{n}\), and you want to compute 
      \[
        P(x) \;=\; a_{0} \;+\; a_{1}x \;+\; \cdots \;+\; a_{d}x^{n}
      \]
      for some given value of \(x\).
      This is an example of the 
      <a class="problem" 
      href="?path=Problems/Foundational/Polynomial%20Evaluation">Polynomial Evaluation</a> problem.
      You should read that page if you are unfamiliar with the problem.
      In a Brute Force approach to solving it, you follow the definition directly: 
      for each term \(a_{i}x^{i}\), you multiply \(a_{i}\)
      by \(x\) \(i\) times, mirroring the definition of each power.
      You then add that to a running total. Here is an example of pseudocode for this algorithm,
      where \(A\) is an array of the \(n+1\) coefficients, and 
      \(x\) is the value to evaluate the polynomial at.
    </p>

    <pre><code>function evalPoly(A, n ,x):
    result = 0
    for i from 0 to n:
        term = A[i]
        for j from 1 to i:
            term = term * x
        result = result + term
    return result
</code></pre>
<p>
Here is a simple example that walks through the evaluation of a polynomial of degree 6
using the algorithm.</p>
    <div class="embeddedDemoContainer">
      <iframe
        class="embeddedDemo"
        src="/Algorithms/Content/Demos/Brute Force/Polynomial Evaluation (Quadratic) Demo.html"
        allow="fullscreen"
        name="BF-poly-eval-demo"
        style="height: 450px; min-height: 450px;"
      ></iframe>
    </div>
    <p>
      Next, we determine the computational complexity of the algorithm.
      Note that the inner loop multiplies \(\text{A}[i]\) by \(x\) exactly \(i\) times, 
      mirroring the definition of each power. 
      Because for each \(i\) (from \(0\) through \(n\)) you perform \(i\) multiplications, 
      the total work is on the order of
      \[
        \sum_{i=0}^{n} i \;=\; \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \;=\; O(n^{2}).
      \]
    </p>
    <p>
      Although straightforward to implement, this approach spends a lot of time recomputing 
      powers from scratch. 
      Later we explore two alternatives that improve the running time to \(O(n)\). 
      One uses an accumulator for the powers so it does not have to compute each one from scratch, 
      and the other one (called Horner’s Rule) rewrites the polynomial as a nested product 
      so that it only needs a single loop of \(n\) multiplications and additions.
      Although they are both \(O(n)\),
      the latter is slighlty faster because it uses about half as many multiplications.

<!-- Applicability -->
<section id="applicability">
  <h2>When to Use</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Small Input Sizes:</strong> Works well when the problem’s parameters (e.g., array size) remain low enough that a straightforward, brute-force approach completes quickly.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Specification-Driven Accuracy:</strong> When you need a guaranteed-correct, “follow-the-definition” implementation with minimal risk of subtle logic errors.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Rapid Prototyping &amp; Debugging:</strong> When you want a quick proof-of-concept or baseline to verify problem constraints and outputs before investing time in optimization.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Educational or Illustrative Purposes:</strong> When demonstrating how a problem works “from first principles” or teaching algorithmic fundamentals—clarity outweighs performance.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Limited Development Time:</strong> When deadlines demand a working solution now, and you can tolerate slower runtimes in exchange for faster coding and fewer bugs.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Fallback for Small Cases in a Hybrid Approach:</strong> When combining multiple techniques (e.g., use brute force for base cases and switch to a more advanced method once inputs exceed a threshold).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Resource Constraints Favor Simplicity:</strong> When you’re coding in an environment where complex libraries or frameworks aren’t available, and a direct loop or recursion is the most practical option.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In essence, choose brute force when correctness and simplicity matter more than speed—especially for small-to-moderate inputs, initial prototyping, or educational clarity. As soon as input sizes grow or performance becomes critical, consider more efficient techniques.
  </p>
</section>
  
<section id="limitations">
  <h2>Limitations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Unnecessary Repetition:</strong> Since the brute-force method often recomputes the same values or explores the same partial solutions repeatedly, it can waste significant time even on moderately sized inputs.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Exponential or High Polynomial Time:</strong> For many problems (e.g., recursive Fibonacci), the running time grows as quickly, and for other enumeration tasks (e.g., subsets, permutations) it can be exponential. In practice, this quickly becomes infeasible as the size of the problem increases.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>High Constant Factors:</strong> Even if the asymptotic growth is reasonable, the overhead from redundant loops or recursive calls can introduce large constants that make the brute-force approach slow in real‐world scenarios.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Deep Recursion Risks:</strong> Recursive brute-force implementations may hit maximum call stack limits or cause stack overflow for larger inputs, forcing either iterative rewrites or explicit stack management.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Lack of Pruning:</strong> Because brute force “checks everything,” it cannot skip obviously irrelevant branches. It won’t take advantage of partial information (e.g., partial sums already exceeding a target), so it can’t terminate early unless a valid solution is found.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Memory Overhead (for Recursion or Candidate Storage):</strong> If the algorithm builds large data structures (e.g., storing all subsets or maintaining deep recursion state), it can exhaust memory even when the time complexity seems manageable.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Poor Insight into Problem Structure:</strong> Brute-force solutions reveal less about patterns or constraints that could lead to more efficient algorithms. Relying too long on brute force can obscure opportunities for pruning, dynamic programming, or greedy strategies.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Not Suitable for Real-Time or Resource-Constrained Environments:</strong> In contexts with strict time, power, or memory budgets (e.g., embedded systems, mobile apps), brute-force methods often exceed allowable limits, necessitating more specialized techniques.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In summary, while brute force is easy to write and guarantees a correct result, these drawbacks—redundancy, high time/memory costs, and lack of pruning—mean it quickly becomes impractical for larger or more complex instances.
  </p>

<!-- Implementation Tips & Common Pitfalls -->
<section id="tips">
  <h2>Implementation Tips &amp; Common Pitfalls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Handle base cases explicitly:</strong> Always check for trivial or empty inputs before diving into recursive calls or loops. For example, in a Fibonacci implementation ensure you handle <code>n ≤ 1</code> so the recursion terminates correctly. In a subset‐generation routine, verify that an empty set is returned when the input size is zero.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Avoid redundant computations:</strong> If your algorithm repeatedly computes the same intermediate value, consider accumulating it instead of recomputing from scratch. For instance, when evaluating a polynomial, maintain a <code>term</code> variable that multiplies by <code>x</code> each loop iteration rather than recomputing <code>x<sup>i</sup></code> from zero. In a naive Fibonacci, you might memoize or cache results to prevent exponential recomputation.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Watch recursion depth:</strong> Deep recursion can lead to stack overflows or excessive memory use. If you’re exploring all combinations of an <em>n</em>-element set, the recursion depth can reach <em>n</em>. For large <em>n</em>, convert to an iterative approach or use an explicit stack. Similarly, if you call <code>fib(n)</code> for large <em>n</em>, consider switching to an iterative or memoized version when <em>n</em> exceeds a safe threshold.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Mind data types and overflow:</strong> When your brute-force loop multiplies values many times or builds large structures, you risk integer overflow or floating-point precision loss. For example, computing <code>x<sup>d</sup></code> by repeated multiplication can overflow a 32-bit integer if <em>d</em> is large. Use a larger numeric type or a big-integer library when necessary.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Generate candidates efficiently:</strong> Hard-coding nested loops for each case quickly becomes unmanageable. Instead, use a general recursive or iterative pattern that can handle any size. For example, generate all subsets via a “choose/not-choose” recursion so you don’t need a separate loop for each subset size. This same pattern applies whether you’re listing all binary strings of length <em>n</em> or enumerating permutations.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Test on small inputs first:</strong> Validate correctness by running your brute-force code on minimal cases (e.g., <code>fib(3)</code> or a 3-term polynomial). Print intermediate values or recursion traces to confirm that you’re visiting every candidate or computing every term correctly. This makes it easier to catch off-by-one errors or omitted cases before scaling up.
    </li>
  </ul>

    <li>
      <strong>Cryptanalysis &amp; Password Cracking:</strong>

<!-- Summary -->
<section id="summary">
  <h2>Summary &amp; Key Takeaways</h2>
  <p>
    Brute Force involves applying the problem’s definition exactly—trying every possibility or following a formula verbatim—trading performance for simplicity. It provides a clear, easy-to-implement solution that is less prone to subtle bugs and serves as a reliable correctness check.

      <li>
        <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
        To “follow the problem’s specification verbatim” means implementing exactly what the problem statement says—no shortcuts or hidden optimizations. For example, computing Fibonacci by literally calling \(F(n-1)\) and \(F(n-2)\) until reaching \(n ≤ 1\). Because every step corresponds directly to the definition, the code is less prone to subtle logic errors (e.g., off-by-one mistakes or incorrect base-case handling).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
        The naive <code>fib(n)</code> implementation makes recursive calls until it reaches the base cases (\(F(0)=0\), \(F(1)=1\)). Each call eventually adds a 0 or 1. The total number of calls is proportional to \(F(n)\) itself. Since
        \[
          F(n) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\Bigl(\tfrac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\Bigr)^{n} - \ldots,
        \]
        we write the cost as 
        \[
          O\bigl(F(n)\bigr) \;=\; O\!\Bigl(\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\bigl(\tfrac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\bigr)^{n}\Bigr).
        \]
        As \(n\) grows, \(\bigl(\tfrac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\bigr)^{n}\) (approximately \(1.618^n\)) grows exponentially, so the runtime becomes impractically large for moderate \(n\).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
        For each \(i = 0\) to \(n\), we compute 
        \[
          \text{term} = a_{i} x^{i}
        \]
        by starting with \(\text{term} = a_{i}\) and multiplying by \(x\) exactly \(i\) times. Thus, computing \(a_{i}x^{i}\) costs \(i\) multiplications. Summing those costs from \(i=0\) to \(n\) gives
        \[
          \sum_{i=0}^{n} i \;=\; \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \;=\; O(n^{2}).
        \]
        Hence, the nested loops produce quadratic growth.

        <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
        1. <strong>Small Input Sizes:</strong> When \(n\) or \(d\) is small (e.g., computing <code>fib(5)</code> or evaluating a 3-term polynomial), brute force completes very quickly with minimal code.<br>
        2. <strong>Specification-Driven Accuracy:</strong> If you need a bulletproof, “do exactly what the problem says” solution—such as a simple sequential search in a small array—brute force minimizes the chance of bugs.<br>
        3. <strong>Educational/Illustrative Purposes:</strong> Demonstrating how an algorithm works “from first principles,” like showing the full recursion tree for <code>fib(5)</code>, where clarity outweighs performance.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
        • <strong>Lack of Pruning:</strong> The naive Fibonacci code never notices that subproblems repeat; it recomputes the same values instead of stopping early or caching results—this leads to exponentially many calls.<br>
        • <strong>Deep Recursion Risks:</strong> The <code>fib(n)</code> function calls itself twice for each \(n ≥ 2\). If you tried <code>fib(50)</code>, recursion depth could exceed call-stack limits, causing a stack overflow. Enumerating all subsets of a large set also pushes recursion depth to the size of the set, risking runtime errors.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
        <strong>Selection Sort:</strong> Each pass scans the unsorted portion of the array to find the minimum (or maximum) element and swaps it into place. For an array of length \(n\), you do \(\sum_{k=1}^{n} k = O(n^{2})\) comparisons. This directly implements “select the next smallest element” by checking every candidate without skipping any.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
        Below is a partial recursion tree for \(F(6)\). Each node is labeled with its argument:

        <pre><code>
                  fib(6)
                 /       \
             fib(5)      fib(4)
             /    \      /    \
         fib(4) fib(3) fib(3) fib(2)
         /   \   /   \   /   \   /  \
        fib(3) fib(2) ... etc. ...    fib(0)
        
        ... (Continue until all leaves are fib(1) or fib(0).
             Your tree should have 25 nodes.)</code></pre>

        If we let \(\text{Calls}(k)\) represent the nuumber of calls made by <code>fibA(k)</code>,
        a precise count of calls is 
        \[
        \begin{aligned}
        \text{Calls}(6) 
          &= 1 + \text{Calls}(5) + \text{Calls}(4) \\
          &= 1 + \bigl(1 + \text{Calls}(4) + \text{Calls}(3)\bigr)
                + \bigl(1 + \text{Calls}(3) + \text{Calls}(2)\bigr) \\
          &= 1 + (1 + (1 + \text{Calls}(3) + \text{Calls}(2)) + (1 + \text{Calls}(2) + \text{Calls}(1))) \\
          &\quad + (1 + (1 + \text{Calls}(2) + \text{Calls}(1)) + (1 + \text{Calls}(1) + \text{Calls}(0))) \\
          &\;=\; \ldots = 25 \quad\text{total calls.}
        \end{aligned}
        \]
        Hence, computing \(F(6)\) by naive recursion makes 25 function calls in total.

      <li>
        <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
        We want to evaluate 
        \[
          P(2) = 2 + 3\cdot2 - 1\cdot2^{2} + 5\cdot2^{3} - 4\cdot2^{4}.
        \]
        Using the naive algorithm:

        <ol>
          <li>\(i = 0:\) \(\text{term} = a_{0} = 2.\) No multiplications needed (since \(2^{0} = 1\)). Running total = \(2.\)</li>
          <li>\(i = 1:\) \(\text{term} = a_{1} = 3.\) Multiply by \(x\) once: \(3 \times 2 = 6.\) Running total = \(2 + 6 = 8.\)</li>
          <li>\(i = 2:\) \(\text{term} = a_{2} = -1.\) Multiply by \(x\) twice: 
            \[
              -1 \times 2 = -2,\quad -2 \times 2 = -4.
            \]
            Running total = \(8 + (-4) = 4.\)
          </li>
          <li>\(i = 3:\) \(\text{term} = a_{3} = 5.\) Multiply by \(x\) three times:
            \[
              5 \times 2 = 10,\quad 10 \times 2 = 20,\quad 20 \times 2 = 40.
            \]
            Running total = \(4 + 40 = 44.\)
          </li>
          <li>\(i = 4:\) \(\text{term} = a_{4} = -4.\) Multiply by \(x\) four times:
            \[
              -4 \times 2 = -8,\quad -8 \times 2 = -16,\quad -16 \times 2 = -32,\quad -32 \times 2 = -64.
            \]
            Running total = \(44 + (-64) = -20.\)
          </li>
        </ol>
        Therefore, \(P(2) = -20.\)
