  <h1>Backtracking</h1>

 <!-- Motivation & Introduction -->
<section id="introduction">
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Backtracking is a general algorithmic technique for solving problems incrementally,
    building candidates to the solutions piece by piece and abandoning a candidate
    ("backtracking") as soon as it is determined that this candidate cannot possibly
    lead to a valid solution. It is especially useful for combinatorial search and
    constraint-satisfaction problems where the solution space is large but can be
    pruned by early detection of infeasible partial solutions.
  </p>
  <p>
    A motivating example is the <em>subset-sum</em> problem: given a set of integers
    \(\{a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\}\) and a target \(T\), find a subset whose elements sum
    to \(T\). A backtracking approach tries to include or exclude each \(a_i\) in turn,
    and as soon as the partial sum exceeds \(T\), it abandons that branch.
  </p>
  <p>
    Backtracking works well on problems such as:
    <ul>
      <li>Subset-sum and knapsack-style searches</li>
      <li>Permutation and combination generation</li>
      <li>Constraint satisfaction (e.g. graph coloring, Sudoku)</li>
      <li>Combinatorial puzzles (e.g. n-queens, magic squares)</li>
      <li>Path-finding in graphs with constraints (e.g. Hamiltonian paths)</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    In this chapter we will present two canonical examples of backtracking:
    the <em>subset-sum</em> problem and the <em>n-queens</em> problem.
  </p>

    <h2>Examples</h2>
	
 <div class="example-box">
  <strong class="example-title">Example 1: Subset-Sum Problem</strong>
  <p>
    In the <em>subset-sum</em> problem, given a set \(S = \{a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\}\)
    (typically stored in an array)
    and a target \(T\), we want to find a subset whose elements sum to \(T\).
    For example, if \(S=\{2, 5, 7, 11, 13\}\) and \(T=18\), then there is at least one solution:  
    \(\{2, 5, 11\}\). But if \(T=19\), then there is not (check for yourself).
    For more details about this problem, see the
    <a class="problem" href="?path=Problems/Other/Subset Sum">Subset Sum</a> problem page.
  </p>
  <p>
    The backtracking algorithm to solve subset sum explores each element either including or excluding it,
    and prunes any branch where the partial sum exceeds \(T\).
    So, for instance, we decide to see what happens if we take the first item. Once we have done
    that we decide to take the second item. And so on. At some point we try to take an item and the
    value makes the sum of the elements in the subset add to a number larger than the target. So
    we backtrack and then see what happens if we do not take that item. 
    If this is a bit confusing, do not worry. The following example should help you visualize
    what is happenning.

  </div>
   <p>In the following pseudocode, we assume for simplicity that the array \(S\) of values and the
  target \(T\) are global variable (or fields). In the code the sum of the current subset is maintained
  and passed to recursive calls so it does not need to be recomputed from scratch.</p>
  <pre><code>backtrackSubsetSum(i, currentSubset, currentSum):
    if currentSum == T:
        output(currentSubset)    // Solution found!
        return 
    if i == n or currentSum > T: // No more items or target exceeded
        return

    // Include S[i]
    currentSubset.add(S[i])
    backtrackSubsetSum(i + 1, currentSubset, currentSum + S[i])
    currentSubset.remove(S[i])

    // Exclude S[i]
    backtrackSubsetSum(i + 1, currentSubset, currentSum)
</code></pre>

  <p><strong>Time complexity:</strong> Worst-case \(O(2^n)\), though pruning often reduces the search space.</p>
  <p><strong>Space complexity:</strong> \(O(n)\) for the recursion stack and current subset.</p>
  <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Systematically enumerates all subsets, abandoning any
     with partial sums exceeding \(T\), and outputs each valid solution.</p>

<!-- Pseudocode Skeleton OPTIONAL. Only if it makes sense for the technique.-->
<section id="pseudocode">
  <h2>Pseudocode Skeleton</h2>
  <p>
    Backtracking works by gradually building a partial solution one choice at a time,
    checking at each step whether it can still lead to a valid complete solution.
    If the partial solution is complete, we record it; otherwise we generate all
    possible next choices, prune those that violate constraints, and recurse on each
    promising extension. After exploring one branch, we remove the last choice
    (backtrack) and try the next. Here is a generic backtracking algorithm based on this idea:
  </p>
  <pre><code>backtrack(partialSolution):
    if isCompleteSolution(partialSolution):
            output(partialSolution)
        return
    for choice in getChoices(partialSolution):
        if isPromising(choice, partialSolution):
            partialSolution.add(choice)
            backtrack(partialSolution)
            partialSolution.remove(choice)</code></pre>
    <p>
    In order to implement a backtracking algorithm using this skeleton, 
    you need to figure out what it means to implement each
    of the following functions.
    <ul>
    <li><code>isCompleteSolution</code>: Based on the criteria for the given problem, you need to determine
    if the partial solution is actually a full solution. 
    For instance, with subset sum, we return true if and only if the numbers
    in the partial solution add up to the target. </li>
    <li><code>getChoices</code>: Determine what choices can be added to the current solution.
    Sometimes this step only adds known valid choices, making the next function, <code>isPromising</code>,
    unnecessary. For subset sum, the choices are to take or not take the next available number on the list.
    This may or may not be promising since adding it may go over the target value.</li>
    <li><code>isPromising</code>: Determine whether or not the partial solution with the new choice added 
    is still promising. For instance, with subset sum, if the sum is above the target, it is not promising,
    and otherwise it is.</li>
    </ul>
    It is also sometimes necessary to add additional parameters to the various functions, depending on 
    both the algorithm and the chosen programming language. For instance, using object-oriented programming
    in Java, the class fields may have the required information and the skeleton above may work fine. But in
    other contexts, you need to know information that is not readily available&mdash;e.g. the list of possible
    values and the target for the subset sum problem.
    </p>
    <p>
    Backtracking can also be implemented iteratively, but then you have to explicietly maintain a stack
    of partial solutions and the implementation gets a bit more complicated. 
    If the depth of the recursive calls is high enough, it can be worth it. 
    But in most cases the recursive implemention is sufficient (and much easier!).
