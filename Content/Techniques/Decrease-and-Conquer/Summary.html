  <h1>Decrease-and-Conquer Summary</h1>
  <section id="summary">
  <h2>Summary and Key Takeaways</h2>
  <p>After reading about the three different flavors of decrease-and-conauer, hopefully these are some of
  the things you learned.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Core idea:</strong> Solve a problem of size \(n\) by reducing it to a smaller problem
      and then solve that subproblem.</li>
      <li><strong>Three flavors</strong>:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Decrease-by-a-constant</strong>: Peel off a fixed amount each step (e.g. \(n\to n-1\)).</li>
            <li><strong>Decrease-by-a-constant-factor</strong>: 
            Shrink by a fixed fraction each time (e.g. \(n\to\lfloor n/2\rfloor\)).</li>
            <li><strong>Variable-size decrease</strong>: 
            Reduce by an input-dependent amount (e.g. Quickselect's pivot split or Euclid's remainder).</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Complexities:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Decrease-by-a-constant:</strong>  
        Often leads to a recurrence of the form \(T(n)=T(n-c)+f(n)\), and with about \(n/c=O(n)\) levels,
        the solution is generally \(T(n)=O\bigl(n\cdot f(n)\bigr)\), where \(f(n)\) is the per-level work.</li>
        <li><strong>Decrease-by-a-constant-factor:</strong>  
          Often leads to a recurrence of the form \(T(n)=T(\lfloor n/b\rfloor)+f(n)\), with
          about \(\Theta(\log_b n)\) levels, generally leading to a complexity of 
          \(T(n)=O\bigl(f(n)\,\log_b n\bigr)\).</li>
        <li><strong>Variable-size decrease:</strong> Because of their unpredictable nature, these are harder 
        to generalize. On average, they have simlar performance to decrease-by-a-constant-factor algorithms
        (assuming they generally have "nice" splits/division), and
        in the worst-case, they are similar to decrease-by-a-constant algorithms (assuming they have "poor"
        splits/divisions).
    </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>When to Reach For It:</strong>  
Ideal when you can "peel off" a single subproblem&mdash;by a fixed amount, a fixed fraction, or adaptively&mdash;and funnel all work through one chain of reductions rather than branching into multiple independent calls (in which case divide-and-conquer might be more appropriate).</li>

  <li><strong>Limitations:</strong> Beware of worst-case degradation (e.g. bad pivots), deep recursion stacks, and hidden \(O(n)\) costs from slicing or division.</li>
  <li><strong>Real-world impact:</strong> Algorithms based on this technique are applicable to a wide
  range of applications, from high-speed search (binary search) and selection (Quickselect) to numeric routines (binary GCD) and cryptographic operations (modular exponentiation)&mdash;demonstrating broad practical utility.</li>
  <li><strong>Implementation considerations:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Define and test a clear base case (e.g. stop when \(n\le1\) or at a small threshold) to prevent infinite recursion or loops.</li>
        <li>Use a straightforward loop instead of recursion when you're just decrementing by a fixed amount 
        to eliminate the overhead of repeated function calls.</li>
        <li>Enable tail-call elimination to avoid deep call stacks and reduce overhead.</li>
        <li>In variable-size methods, choose robust pivots (e.g. randomized or median-of-medians) to guard against unbalanced splits that lead to bad worst-case behavior.</li>
    <li>When a subproblem's size falls below a tuned cutoff (e.g. \(n \le 16\)), switch to a direct iterative or closed-form method&mdash;such as a simple loop, lookup, or formula&mdash;instead of another recursive or factor-based step, to eliminate extra call and partitioning overhead on very small inputs.</li>
        <li>Watch your stack usage: unoptimized recursion can consume \(O(n)\) or \(O(\log n)\) frames; prefer iterative forms when \(O(1)\) extra space is needed.</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>

        <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
        Reduce the problem to one smaller instance; recurse on it; then determine the final solution

        <strong>Answer:</strong><br>
        An off-by-one in size reduction (e.g. mixing \(\lfloor n/b\rfloor\) and \(\lceil n/b\rceil\)) can leave subproblems unchanged or skip elements, causing incorrect behavior or infinite loops.

  <h2>Homework Problems</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>
      <strong>Kth-Order Statistic Algorithms</strong><br>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Describe a simple (but not necessarily efficient) algorithm to solve the\(k\)-th order statistic problem
        and give its complexity.</li>
        <li>Describe Quickselect with random pivot: give pseudocode, derive the average-case recurrence, 
        and solve for its expected time.</li>
        <li>Describe the median-of-medians algorithm: give pseudocode, derive the worst-case recurrence  
          \(\;T(n)=T(n/5)+T(7n/10)+O(n)\;\), and show it is \(O(n)\).
          (You are allowed to consult outside sources for this part since we did not provide the details!)</li>
        <li>Compare the practical trade-offs between Quickselect and median-of-medians 
        (average vs worst case, constant factors, space, etc.).</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>First-Occurrence Binary Search:</strong><br>
      Modify the standard binary search pseudocode so that, in a sorted array with duplicate values, it returns the index of the first occurrence of the target. Explain why your modification still runs in \(O(\log n)\) time.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Tail-Call Elimination:</strong><br>
      Show how to convert the recursive binary search into a tail-recursive form. Then rewrite it as a purely iterative function. Discuss the impact on time and space complexity.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Design a Shrink-By-Three Algorithm:</strong><br>
      Propose an algorithm that computes \(\lfloor n/3\rfloor\) by decrease-by-a-constant each step. Write its recurrence and determine its time and space complexities.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Hybrid Threshold Tuning:</strong><br>
      For Quickselect, experiment with different small-case cutoff values \(k\in\{8,16,32,64\}\) where you switch to insertion sort. On arrays of size 10,000, measure the average running time and identify the optimal \(k\). Explain why that cutoff is best.
    </li>
     <li>
      <strong>Counterfeit Coin Puzzle (divide into thirds):</strong><br>
      You have \(N\) coins, one of which is heavier.

      <strong>Ternary Search on a Unimodal Function:</strong><br>
      Given a unimodal function \(f\) on a closed interval \([a,b]\) (that is, it strictly increases then strictly decreases), implement a divide-into-thirds (decrease-by-a-constant-factor) procedure to approximate the maximum point to within an error \(\varepsilon\). Write pseudocode and bound the number of function evaluations in terms of \(\log_3\bigl(\tfrac{b-a}{\varepsilon}\bigr)\).

    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Search in a Rotated Sorted Array:</strong><br>

    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Peak in a Bitonic Array:</strong><br>
      A bitonic array first strictly increases and then strictly decreases. Write a decrease-by-a-constant-factor (binary search) algorithm to locate the peak element in \(O(\log n)\) time, and explain why it works.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Defective Batch Testing:</strong><br>
      You have \(n\) items, exactly one of which is defective. You can test any subset and learn whether it contains the defective item. Design an algorithm to pinpoint the defective item using the fewest tests possible. Provide pseudocode and an analysis of the number of tests required.
