          <h2>Introduction &amp; Purpose</h2>
          <p>
            The purpose of this project is to serve as a comprehensive, open-access resource for algorithm-related 
            courses. It is designed to replace traditional textbooks and make algorithms as intuitive and engaging 
            as possible. By combining interactive demos, clear explanations, and human-verified content (In order 
            to speed up the process, we are heavily leveraging AI (specifically ChatGPT) in the creation of the content&mdash;especially the demos), 
            this site aims to bring algorithmic concepts to life for students and instructors alike.
          </p>
          <p>Current focus:</p>
          <ul class="resource-list">
            <li>Create and refine core content suitable for an <em>Introduction to Algorithms</em> course.</li>
            <li>Develop interactive demos that illustrate each algorithm step by step.</li>
            <li>Organize material into “textbook modules” that can be assembled to fit different course structures.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Future plans include grouping existing and forthcoming chapters into cohesive “textbooks” tailored to specific courses (e.g., Intro to Algorithms, Advanced Algorithms, Intro to Data Structures). Until then, please explore individual chapters and demos via the sidebar menu.

          <h2>Development Timeline</h2>
          <ul class="resource-list">
            <li>
              <strong>By Fall 2025:</strong>
              <ul>
              <li>Enough content for a most of an <em>Introduction to Algorithms</em> course
              that covers the design and analysis of algorithms for sorting, searching, various 
              graph problems, etc., and the important design techniques such as brute force,
              divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, etc.</li>
              <li>Although we made an incredible amount of progress this summer, creating content for an
              entire course is a daunting task. I will continue to
              work during the fall to finish material that will be needed for the last third or so
              of my course.</li>
              <li>For my course, material on asymptotic notation and algorithm analysis will be taken
              from <a href="https://cusack.hope.edu/Notes/Notes/Books/AIDMA/AIDMA.3.5.pdf" 
              target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An
              Active Introduction to Discrete Mathematics and Algorithms</a>
              until at least 2026 when there is time to convert that material to this format.
              </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>By Fall 2026</strong> (Tentative&mdash;may swap 2026/2027):
              <ul>
              <li>Expanded content to include material for an <em>Advanced Algorithms</em> course
              that digs deeper into the various algorithmic techniques, 
              and (ideally) a few parallel algorithms examples and demos.</li>
              <li>Hopefully asymptotic notation and an introduction to algorithm analysis will also
              be added (since I have another good resource for that material, it is not on the
              top of the list).</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>By Fall 2027</strong> (Tentative&mdash;may swap 2026/2027):
              <ul>
              <li>A complete suite of materials for an <em>Introduction to Data Structures</em> course, 
              featuring each major data structure, analysis, and hands-on demos 
              (e.g., linked-lists, stacks, queues, heaps, balanced trees, hash tables).</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We are continuously adding and refining material. Check back regularly for updates.
