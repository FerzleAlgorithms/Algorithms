  <h2>How to Use This Book</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Problem</strong> pages should be read in their entirety.
    Each <strong>Algorithm</strong> and <strong>Technique</strong> 
	page follows a similar structure, with some of the content being required reading and 
	other content being advanced/optional. 
    The lists below outline which sections are required for a basic understanding 
    and which are best explored later as you are seeking to deepen your understanding of the
    algorithms and techniques.
  </p>

  <h3>Required Reading</h3>
  <p>
    These sections form the foundation of each chapter.  
    Read them carefully and make sure you can explain the ideas in your own words before moving on.
  </p>
  <ul class="spaced">
    <li><strong>Problem Solved:</strong> 
	Describes the problem solved by the given algorithm and links to its main definition.  
      Always review this link so you know exactly what task the algorithm handles.</li>
    <li><strong>Design and Strategy / Description</strong> 
      (or <strong>Introduction</strong> for technique pages): Explains the core idea, motivation, and structure of the algorithm, 
      often with short examples or pseudocode.</li>
    <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Small, worked traces that illustrate each step of the process.</li>
    <li><strong>Interactive Demos:</strong> Embedded visualizations that show the algorithm in motion.  
      Use them to connect intuition with the formal explanation.</li>
    <li><strong>Time/Space Analysis:</strong> Explains efficiency—best, worst, and average cases—along with 
      any extra memory requirements.</li>
    <li><strong>Summary &amp; Key Takeaways</strong> (for techniques): Brief recap of the central insights and lessons.</li>
    <li><strong>Reading Comprehension Questions:</strong> Short self-checks to test understanding.  
      <em>Always answer these before continuing, and verify your responses.</em></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Digging In a Bit More</h3>
  <p>
    Once you grasp the main ideas, these sections help you refine your understanding,  
    explore trade-offs, and think about practical implementation.
	You can consider these sections as helpful to deepen your understanding, 
	but not absolutely required. However, if your courses is more applied than theoretical, these 
	sections may come in very handy!
  </p>
  <ul class="spaced">    
    <li><strong>Implementation in Java, C++, Python:</strong> Reference code in the three main languages.  
      Focus on the language you use most, but compare others to notice design patterns.</li>
    <li><strong>When to Use:</strong> Describes the types of problems and conditions where the approach performs best.</li>
    <li><strong>Variations / Improvements:</strong> Covers minor tweaks, heuristics, or optimizations that extend or improve the basic method.</li>
    <li><strong>Limitations:</strong> Notes common constraints, weaknesses, or situations where the algorithm underperforms.</li>
    <li><strong>Implementation Tips / Common Pitfalls:</strong> Practical guidance for avoiding common coding or reasoning errors.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Moving On</h3>
  <p>
    These sections help connect ideas across topics, link algorithms to real-world use,  
    and provide structured ways to apply what you’ve learned. If a particular topic interests you,
	here is where you will learn more details than will probably be covered in class.
	For the most part, you can probably consider these sections optional unless your instructor
	mentions otherwise.
  </p>
  <ul class="spaced">
    <li><strong>Links to Resources / Related Links and Resources:</strong> Curated references for further reading and exploration.</li> 
    <li><strong>Variants / Related Problems:</strong> Alternative problem statements that share similar reasoning or techniques.</li>
    <li><strong>Real-World Applications:</strong> Examples from computing, science, or engineering that show where the algorithm appears in practice.</li>
    <li><strong>Algorithms Using This Technique:</strong> Pointers to other algorithms that rely on the same general method.</li>
    <li><strong>In-Class Activities:</strong> Hands-on exercises and group explorations designed for active engagement. Your instructor may visit some of the activities during class.</li>
    <li><strong>Homework Problems:</strong> Formal practice opportunities to reinforce learning and connect ideas between chapters. Your instructor may assign homework assignments using these problems.</li>   
  </ul>
