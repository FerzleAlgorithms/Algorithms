<h1>Sequential Search</h1>

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p>Given an array of elements and a value to search for, determine the index at which the value is located or return -1 if the value is not present in the array.</p>

<h2>Algorithm Idea</h2>
<p>Sequential search (also called linear search) checks each element in the array one-by-one, from the beginning until the desired value is found or the end is reached.</p>

<h2>Talk Through Creation of Algorithm</h2>
<p>The simplest way to find an item in a list is to examine each element sequentially. If the current element matches the searched value, return its index. If no match is found by the end of the list, return -1.</p>

<h2>Pseudocode</h2>
<pre>
SequentialSearch(array, value):
  for i from 0 to length(array) - 1:
    if array[i] == value:
      return i
  return -1
</pre>

<h2>Time and Space Analysis</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> O(n) - each element is checked once in the worst case.</li>
  <li><strong>Space Complexity:</strong> O(1) - no additional space needed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Variations and Enhancements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Early exit if the array is sorted and the current element is greater than the searched value.</li>
  <li>Parallel implementation to check multiple elements simultaneously.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Apply Ideas to New Problems (Reader Guided)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>How would the algorithm change if the array were sorted?</li>
  <li>Consider implementing sequential search on linked lists. What changes?</li>

<h2>Reading Comprehension Questions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>What is the worst-case time complexity of sequential search? Why?</li>
  <li>If the search value is at the first position, how many comparisons are made?</li>
</ol>
<details>
<summary>Solutions</summary>
<ol>
  <li>O(n), because in the worst case it checks all elements once.</li>
  <li>Only one comparison is made.</li>
</ol>

<h2>In-Class Activities</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Have students implement sequential search in their preferred programming language.</li>
  <li>Discuss and demonstrate variations and their impacts on performance.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Problems</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Implement sequential search and verify it with various test cases.</li>
  <li>Analyze how early termination affects the average performance.</li>
</ul>
