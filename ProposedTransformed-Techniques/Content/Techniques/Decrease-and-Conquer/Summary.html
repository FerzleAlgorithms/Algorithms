  <h1>Decrease-and-Conquer Summary</h1>
  <section id="summary" section-title="Summary and Key Takeaways">
  <h2>Summary and Key Takeaways</h2>
  <p>After reading about the three different flavors of decrease-and-conauer, hopefully these are some of
  the things you learned.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Core idea:</strong> Solve a problem of size \(n\) by reducing it to a smaller problem
      and then solve that subproblem.</li>
      <li><strong>Three flavors</strong>:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Decrease-by-a-constant</strong>: Peel off a fixed amount each step (e.g. \(n\to n-1\)).</li>
            <li><strong>Decrease-by-a-constant-factor</strong>: 
            Shrink by a fixed fraction each time (e.g. \(n\to\lfloor n/2\rfloor\)).</li>
            <li><strong>Variable-size decrease</strong>: 
            Reduce by an input-dependent amount (e.g. Quickselect's pivot split or Euclid's remainder).</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Complexities:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Decrease-by-a-constant:</strong>  
        Often leads to a recurrence of the form \(T(n)=T(n-c)+f(n)\), and with about \(n/c=O(n)\) levels,
        the solution is generally \(T(n)=O\bigl(n\cdot f(n)\bigr)\), where \(f(n)\) is the per-level work.</li>
        <li><strong>Decrease-by-a-constant-factor:</strong>  
          Often leads to a recurrence of the form \(T(n)=T(\lfloor n/b\rfloor)+f(n)\), with
          about \(\Theta(\log_b n)\) levels, generally leading to a complexity of 
          \(T(n)=O\bigl(f(n)\,\log_b n\bigr)\).</li>
        <li><strong>Variable-size decrease:</strong> Because of their unpredictable nature, these are harder 
        to generalize. On average, they have simlar performance to decrease-by-a-constant-factor algorithms
        (assuming they generally have "nice" splits/division), and
        in the worst-case, they are similar to decrease-by-a-constant algorithms (assuming they have "poor"
        splits/divisions).
    </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>When to Reach For It:</strong>  
Ideal when you can "peel off" a single subproblem&mdash;by a fixed amount, a fixed fraction, or adaptively&mdash;and funnel all work through one chain of reductions rather than branching into multiple independent calls (in which case divide-and-conquer might be more appropriate).</li>

  <li><strong>Limitations:</strong> Beware of worst-case degradation (e.g. bad pivots), deep recursion stacks, and hidden \(O(n)\) costs from slicing or division.</li>
  <li><strong>Real-world impact:</strong> Algorithms based on this technique are applicable to a wide
  range of applications, from high-speed search (binary search) and selection (Quickselect) to numeric routines (binary GCD) and cryptographic operations (modular exponentiation)&mdash;demonstrating broad practical utility.</li>
  <li><strong>Implementation considerations:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Define and test a clear base case (e.g. stop when \(n\le1\) or at a small threshold) to prevent infinite recursion or loops.</li>
        <li>Use a straightforward loop instead of recursion when you're just decrementing by a fixed amount 
        to eliminate the overhead of repeated function calls.</li>
        <li>Enable tail-call elimination to avoid deep call stacks and reduce overhead.</li>
        <li>In variable-size methods, choose robust pivots (e.g. randomized or median-of-medians) to guard against unbalanced splits that lead to bad worst-case behavior.</li>
    <li>When a subproblem's size falls below a tuned cutoff (e.g. \(n \le 16\)), switch to a direct iterative or closed-form method&mdash;such as a simple loop, lookup, or formula&mdash;instead of another recursive or factor-based step, to eliminate extra call and partitioning overhead on very small inputs.</li>
        <li>Watch your stack usage: unoptimized recursion can consume \(O(n)\) or \(O(\log n)\) frames; prefer iterative forms when \(O(1)\) extra space is needed.</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>In-Class Activities</h2>
  <ol>    
  <li>
      <strong>Flavor Classification:</strong><br>
      For each of the following, state which decrease-and-conquer flavor it uses 
      (<em>constant</em>, <em>constant-factor</em>, or <em>variable-size</em>):<br>
      (a) linear search in an array,<br>
      (b) computing \(2^n\) by repeated doubling,<br>
      (c) Quickselect for the median.
    </li>
	 <li>
    <strong>Algorithm Transformation:</strong><br>
    Problem: Find the number of even integers in an array of 1000 random integers between 1 and 9999.  
    Design a solution using each flavor of decrease-and-conquer:
    <ul>
      <li><em>(a)</em> Constant Decrease: Check and remove one element per step.</li>
      <li><em>(b)</em> Constant-Factor Decrease: Split the array in half at each step and process one half.</li>
      <li><em>(c)</em> Variable-Size Decrease: Use an adaptive strategy—e.g., partition the array by a pivot and recurse on the side likely to contain more evens.</li>
    </ul>
    Write pseudocode or describe each approach. Compare their efficiency and overhead.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Recurrence Matching:</strong><br>
    The following recurrence relations describe the running times of three different decrease-and-conquer algorithms:
    <ul>
      <li>\(T(n) = T(n - 1) + O(1)\)</li>
      <li>\(T(n) = T(n/2) + O(1)\)</li>
      <li>\(T(n) = T(k) + O(n)\), where \(k\) depends on the result of a partitioning step</li>
    </ul>
    Match each recurrence to one of the three decrease-and-conquer flavors and name a representative algorithm for each.  
    Explain how the recurrence structure reflects the algorithm’s behavior.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Algorithm Comparison:</strong><br>
    Consider the problem of finding the \(k\)-th smallest element in an array of 30 integers.  
    Discuss how you would approach it using:  
    <em>(a)</em> brute force,  
    <em>(b)</em> sorting then indexing, and  
    <em>(c)</em> Quickselect (variable-size-decrease).  
    Which is most efficient for large \(n\), and why?
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Real-World Analogy Brainstorm:</strong><br>
    Think of real-world tasks that correspond to each flavor of decrease-and-conquer.  
    For example, checking items off a to-do list (constant), halving the search space in a game (constant-factor), or removing random-sized chunks of a task (variable-size).  
    Share examples with the class and discuss how the choice of strategy affects efficiency.

    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Defective Batch Testing:</strong><br>
